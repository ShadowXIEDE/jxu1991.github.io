I received the B.Sc. degree in biomedical engineering and the M.Sc. degree in circuits and
systems from Xidian University, Xiâ€™an, China, in 2012 and 2015, respectively, where I am currently
pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the School of Electronic Engineering.
Meanwhile, I study in University of Pittsburgh as a joint doctoral student.

My research interests include machine learning, computer vision and artificial intelligence.
